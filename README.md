# Data Structures and Algorithm, UPES

This repository contains all the Lab experiments I have performed while learning the course Data Structures and Algorithm at UPES. 

Contents : 

1. **Arrays** - operations on 1D & 2D arrays 
2. **Structure and Unions** 
3. **Single Linked Lists** : Insertion (beginning/middle/end) and Deletion (beginning/middle/end)
4. **Doubly Linked Lists and it's operations** (same operations as of single linked lists)
5. **Stack Implementation using linked list** and stack operations
6. **String operations using stack**
7. **Circular Queue with Arrays**
8. **Queue using Stack**
9. **Bubble Sort**
10. **Insertion Sort**
11. **Selection Sort**
12. **Binary and Linear Search**
13. **Binary Search Tree** implementation with insertion, deletion and searching
14. **Hash Table** implementation 
15. **Heap Sort** implementation 

### **Experiment 1 :** 
1. Find sum of all array elements using recursion, iteration.
2. Create an array ‘a1’ with ‘n’ elements. Insert an element in ith position 
of ‘a1’ and also delete an element from jth position of ‘a1’.
3.  Convert uppercase string to lowercase using for loop.
4. Find the sum of rows and columns of matrix of given order (row x 
column).

### **Experiment 2 :**
1. Find the Transpose and Inverse of a matrix
2. Find out the largest and smallest number in a given array
3.  Find the total number of alphabets, digits or special characters in a string.

### **Experiment 3 :**
1. Find whether the entered string is palindrome or not.
2. Count the number of words in a string.
3. Find the product of two matrices using pointers.

### **Experiment 4 :**
1. Add two complex numbers by passing structure to a function as 
argument.
2. Design a structure ‘student_record’ to store student details like name, 
SAP ID, enrollment number, date of registration and data of birth. The 
element date of joining is defined using another structure ‘date’ to store 
date details like day, month, and year. Get data of ‘n’ students and then 
print the entered values. 
3. Store ‘n’ numbers (integers or real) in an array in ascending or 
descending order. Conduct a binary search for a given number and 
report success or failure in the form of a suitable message.

### **Experiment 5 :**
1. Design a structure ‘subject’ to store the details of the subject like subject 
name and subject code. Using structure pointer allocate memory for the 
structure dynamically so as to obtain details of ‘n’ subjects using for 
loop.
2. Implement single Linked List data structure for student and its 
operations like insert and delete in the beginning/end and nth position 
of the list, and display the items stored in the linked list.

### **Experiment 6 :**
1. Implement Doubly Linked List and its operations.
2. Using linked list implement Stack and its operations like insert, delete, and 
display.

### **Experiment 7 :**
1. Reverse the string (using stack)
2. Check if a string is palindrome (using stack)
3. Evaluate a postfix expression using a stack. 

### **Experiment 8 :**
1. Circular queue with arrays

### **Experiment 9 :**
1. Implementation of queue using stack

### **Experiment 10 :**
1. Bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort.
2. Binary search and linear search.

### **Experiment 11 :**
1. BST implementation with insertion, searching and deletion. 

### **Experiment 12 :**
1. Hash Table Implementation

### **Experiment 13 :**
1. Heap Sort implementation
